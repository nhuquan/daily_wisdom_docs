Welcome to SoundGround!

At LIVANA COMPANY LIMITED, we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use SoundGround.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Media Playback Controls**: To manage the playback of music files on your device.

## 2. Data Usage

As mentioned above, we do not collect or store any personal data. The app operates entirely offline, meaning all your data (such as your music files) remain on your device, and no information is transmitted to us or any third-party service.

## 3. Third-Party Services

SoundGround does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks that would collect data from your device.

## 4. Security

Since SoundGround does not collect any personal data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised. Your device is responsible for ensuring the security of your stored data.
